Vespen
=========

Vespen is a deobfuscated fork of Fabrice Bellard's jslinux. Much credit is due to Mark Spear for his excellent work further
deobfuscating the code and updating the kernel. I added disk write support in Nov 2012, and have plans to add net support
and some other fun stuff (see Domina.)
